# üöÄ Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet ‚Äì Arrays Section: Problem Solutions

Welcome to the **Arrays** section of my solutions to [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)! This repository contains well-commented implementations of array-related problems from the sheet, aimed at helping both myself and others understand the concepts and solutions clearly.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each file in this repository corresponds to a specific problem from the **Arrays** section of the A2Z DSA Sheet.
The filenames are problem-specific for easy navigation.
All implementations contain:

* ‚úÖ Clean and readable code
* üí¨ **Inline comments** explaining key steps
* üïí **Time** and üì¶ **Space complexity** annotations

## üìò Topics Covered

This section includes problems on:

* Array basics (traversal, input/output)
* Searching & sorting
* Two pointers technique
* Hashing for frequency/count
* Sliding window
* Prefix sums
* Important problem patterns (Kadane‚Äôs, Dutch National Flag, etc.)

## üõ† Languages Used

> Most solutions are written in **\C++**, but contributions in other languages are welcome!

## üöß How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nishantmishra31/arrays.git
cd arrays
```

2. Browse through the filenames to find a specific problem.
3. Open the file to see the explanation and implementation.
4. Use it as a reference for your own learning or coding practice.

## ü§ù Contributions

Want to add your own solutions or improvements? Feel free to open a pull request!
